# keep_awake
Small program to keep your computer awake by moving your mouse every 4 minutes and 30 seconds. No underlying reason for this program at all. Just a simple, innocent Python program...

## Troubleshooting
Make sure all the needed modules/packages are installed. Something like
```
pip install [package_name]
```
in the terminal should do the trick.

Needed packages:
* pyautogui
* datetime
* threading (typically already installed with Python)
