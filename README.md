# keep_awake
Small program to keep your computer awake

## More info
Moves your mouse every 4 minutes and 30 seconds. No underlying reason for this program at all. Just a simple, innocent Python program...

## Troubleshooting
Make sure all the needed modules/packages are installed. 
'''
pip install [package_name]
'''
in terminal should do the trick.
Needed packages:
* pyautogui
* datetime
* threading (typically already installed with Python)
